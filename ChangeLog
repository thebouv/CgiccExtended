  * Updated project file, directory and other build files to reflect correct
    spelling of the project.  Yep, that's all.  :)

  * CgiccExtended.cc : overloaded operator[] for quick access to param values
    * just like param(std::string) actually, just you now have a choice
      * really just a neat feature, though probably not needed since param
        is just as easy to use, and operator overloading is often unecessary
        -- well, its here just in case someone WANTS to access the data
        this way.  I just thought I'd give it a try to test operator overloading
    * idea, though not implementation, borrowed from MizCGI
      * http://www2.swau.edu/~jasonm/mizcgi/

  * CgiccExtended.cc : make header() use cgicc::HTTPContentHeader class
    * so CgiccExtended.hh includes cgicc/HTTPContentHeader.h
  * CgiccExtended.cc : make redirect() use cgicc::HTTPRedirectHeader class
    * so CgiccExtended.hh includes cgicc/HTTPRedirectHeader.h
  * CgiccExtended.cc : dump() now takes delimiter and endline parameters
    * defaults are provided in CgiccExtended.hh
